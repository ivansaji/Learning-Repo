date > /tmp/new.txt
This saves the command (date) result into text file

if we provide dat > /tmp/new.txt, nothing will be written, dat is not a valid command and bash prompts dat: Command not found

If we want to write write the error only into file without displaying error on bash,ie error msg will be writtern to file, use

dat 2> /tmp/new.txt

if the command runs successfully, no error hence nothing will be written

This will overwrite the txt file. 
If we wish to perform an append, then use
da 2>> /tmp/new.txt
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
"|" is used to pipeline, ie one command output servers as input to other

cat /etc/passwd | grep root

this performs grep root on cat /etc/passwd
