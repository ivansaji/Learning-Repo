To add a user
# sudo useradd tom
----------------------------------------------
To set password for user tom
# sudo passwd tom
--------------------------------------------
To switch user(if root) => switch from root to tom
# su - tom
----------------------------------------------------
To switch to root

Ctrl + D or "logout" switches to previous user
-------------------------------------
To get admin privilages for a user, add the user to sudoer's file
Need to be root user

To add a user to sudoers file
# usermod -aG wheel <username>
-aG creates a supplimentary group
----------------------------------------------
to find groups associated to user
# groups tom

the result can be "tom : tom wheel"
tom is the primary group
wheel is the supplimentary group

--------------------------------------
when looked at /etc/passwd we can see
# tail /etc/passwd
we can see last added group jerry

-------------------------------------
"/etc/sudoers" file shows the permission controls for users.
when opened, we can see that 
"
##Allow root to run any commands anywhere 
root    ALL=(ALL)       ALL

"
this line shows that root user has all previlages

to provide all previlages to another user, give it like

username    ALL=(ALL)       ALL
--------------------------------------------

To add a new group (named : redhat)
# groupadd redhat

to make the redhat group the primary group(change primary group from tom to redhat)
#usermod -g redhat tom

---------------------------------------
To get the id of a user
# id <username>
This displays user id, group id etc

------------------------------------
On displaying /etc/passwd we can see that tom has /bin/bash which means he can login to bash shell

to turn off login capability of tom,
# usermod -s /sbin/nologin tom

when we try to login to tom, we cannot login now

to provide login feeature

# usermod -s /bin/bash tom
------------------------------------------
To change group id of a user(change group id of redhat to 3000)
# groupmod -g 3000 redh

to check this "/etc/group" at last we can see redhat with id 3000

Managing user passwords

open the file "/etc/shadow"
we can see encrypted passwords of users aswell as properties

eg: user:$1$xxxxxxxx
if $1 : MD5
if $5 : SHA256
if $6 : SHA512
-------------------------------------------
We can see 'X' in shadow which hides user passwords
This can be unhided to see the user passwords by using shadowutils
install: yum install shadowutils

Two commands can be used to hide and unhide password hash
# pwunconv : unhides the hash
#pwconv : hides the hash

34$sadwhawieufhw : the left of $ is the salt and right is the password hash

The file "/etc/login.defs" stores password information. We can see algorithms there

To change password algorithms : 
# sudo authconfig --passalgo=sha512 --update

A linux tool to view password score is pwscore
# echo "TestPassword" | pwscore

-------------------------------------------
