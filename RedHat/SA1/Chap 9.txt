Configure and securing SSH

Connect to remote machine via ssh
# ssh remotehost
or
# ssh remoteuser@remotehost
or
#ssh remoteuser@remotehost hostname

# w -f  : used to list loggged in users
ssh encrypts through public key encryption
ssh stores server's public key in ~/.ssh/known_hosts


ssh allows users to generate a key which facilitates a password less login

----------Configuration in local machine----------------
ssh keygeneration is done by # ssh-keygen
private key is stored in ~/.shh/id_rsa
public key stored in ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub

To copy ssh key pair to remote host
# ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub remoteuser@remotehost
This asks for root password of remote machine.... after successful authentication.... the local machine can login without password to remote
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Customizing SSH Service configuration
Config file found at /etc/ssh/sshd_config

In the config file to prevent root login using ssh, set PermitRootLogin no
restart ssh service using systemctl restart sshd

To prevent password authentication
Set PasswordAuthentication no 
Restart service

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
In AWS, inorder for ssh-copy-id to work, in /etc/ssh/ssh_config, set PasswordAuthentication to yes and restart service

then run cmd,

then revert that back to no as we are trying password less logins

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
To change ssh from port 22 to 2222

In remote machine
In file /etc/ssh/sshd_config
change 
# Port 22
to 
Port 2222

Now we need to add this change in firewall and semanage

Adding to firewall
# firewall-cmd --permanent --add-port=2222/tcp
Reload firewall
# firewall-cmd --reload

Now listing all ports using Semanage
# semanage port -l |grep ssh

Now adding a port to semanage
# semanage port -a -t ssh_port_t -p tcp 2222

Now when we list out ports in se manage we can see 22 and 2222

Now we need to reload firewall, only then permanaent save occurs
