Creating Links

The purpose of creating links is that when the content of actual file changes, the content of linked files also changes
T
wo types : Hardlink and soft Link
inode number : unique number to represent file in a system
ls -i <file> : used to list using inode number

Creating Hardlink
1. create the file
2. to create hardlink for the file
>> ln <filename> <hardlink_file>
eg>> ln ivan ivan_hardlink

Creating SoftLink
>> ln -s ivan ivan_softlink

Checking inode number of link files
>> ls -i ivan_hardlink
>>ls -i ivan_softlink

when we do this.... The hardlink file has same inode number of source file but softlink file has different inode number.
If we remove the orginal file, hardlink file will exist while softlink will not exist(hardlink is a backup of actual file while softlink is a shortcut)
