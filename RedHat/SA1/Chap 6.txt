Controlling Access to Files

Three Permissions: Read(r), Write(w), Execute(x)

Changing permissions
# chmod who/what/which file/Dir

Symbolic method

Who: u,g,o,a
What : +,-,=
Which : r,w,x

# chmod u+x file1
# chmod g-r file2

Numeric method
r=4 , w=2,x=1

chmod ugo file

eg: # chmod 754 file
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Changing permissions of file
# chown userowner:groupowner file

To change user of a file to suni
# chown suni file

We can also use UserID of user(if UID of suni is 1000)
# chown 1000 file

To change group of a file (user-> suni && group -> poli)
# chown suni:poli file1

To change the group only
# chown :poli file1

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Special Permissions

Symbolically

u+s (suid)
g+s (sgid)
o+t (sticky)

Numerically

Setuid=4
setgid=2
sticky=1

usage: # chmod permisison file

u+s : File executes as the user owns that file, No effect on dir

g+s : files execute as group owns that files, Files newly created in the directory have their group owner set to match group owner of dir

o+t : No effect on files, Users with write on directory can only remove files that they own
