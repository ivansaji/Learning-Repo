Controlling Access to files with ACLs

Interpreting Files
Access Control List(ACL) 

ACL is used to give special permission to single users in others group.
Helps to add permission to single group member by mentioning their name(eg manu in others)
chown gives permission as a group not to a single user
used to give permission to named users

#ls -l lists only minimal ACL settings
+ sign at end of 10 char permission(RWXRW----+) indicates extended ACL permission. 

To display ACL Settings on a file
# getfacl file/directory

To set ACL permission
# setfacl -m user:username:permission file
or
# setfacl -m u:username:permission file
(u/users , o/other, g/group)
eg:# setfacl -m user:mary:rx file

To set ACL permission Recursively
# setfacl -R -m user:username:permission file
eg:# setfacl -R -m user:mary:rx file

# setfacl -m group:groupname:permission directory

To set as default mask(read and execute permission)
# default:m::rx dir/

Named user granted initial read permission for new files
# default:user:mary:rx dir/

--------------------------------------------------------------

The ACL Mask

The ACL mask defines the maximum permission that you can grant to named users, the group owner and named groups

All files and directory that implements ACL will have an ACL mask

------------------------------------------------------------
Deleting ACL permissions

#setfacl -x u:name,g:name file : deleting specific ACL(-x)
#setfacl -b file : delete all ACLs on file or dir

Deleting all default ACL permissions on a dir
#setfacl -k dir
