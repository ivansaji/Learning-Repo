Controlling the boot process

Selecting the boot target

When machine is powered on, the system firmware runs Power on Self Test(POST). The firmware searches for bootable device. either configured in UEFI boot firmware or by searching Master Boot Record(MBR) on all disks inorder configured in the BIOS.

The system firmware loads a bootloader from the disk then passes control to boot loader

Default bootloader for RHEL is GRUB2. Installed using grub2-install command

GRUB2 loads its information from /boot/grub2/grub.cfg and displays a menu where u can select which kernel to boot

/etc/grub.d/ (dir)or /etc/default/grub (file) : configure grub
#grub2-mkconfig : generate /boot/grub2/grub.cfg file

After selecting a kernel, the bootloader loads the kernel and initramfs from disk and places them in memory.
initamfs is an archive containing the kernel modules for all the hardware required at the boot, initialization scripts etc.

#dracut and #lsinitrd commands are used to inspect initramfs file
Dracut is configured in /etc/dracut.conf.d/ directory

initramgs initiates all hardware and executes /sbin/init
/sbin/init is a link to systemd

systemd executes all units under initrd.target which includes mounting root file system on disk onto /sysroot directory

#systemctl poweroff : shutdown command

#systemctl reboot : Restart

poweroff and reboot are symbolic links of systemctl equivalents

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Selecting Systemd target

Systemd target is a set of systemd units, that make the system start in desired state.

graphical.target : Supports multiple users,graphical and text based logins

multi-user.target : supports multiple users, text based logins

rescue.target : sulogin prompt, basic system initialization completed

emergency.target : sulogin(simple User Login) prompt, uintamfs pivot complete and system root mounted on/read only

Managing Targets

#systemctl list-units --type=target --all : to list available targets
#systemctl get-default : To display default target
#systemctl set-default graphical.target : change default target to graphical

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Resetting the root password from bootloader


1. Reboot the system
2. Interrupt the boot loader countdown by pressing any key except enter
3. Move the curser to the kernel entry to boot
4. Press e to edit selected entry
5. Move the curser to the kernel command line( the line that starts with linux)
6. Append rd.break with that option, the ststem breaks just before system hands control from initramfs
7. Press ctrl+x to boot with changes

From here use the following
8. Remount the /sysroot as read/wrte
    #switch_root:/# mount -o remount,rw /sysroot

9. Switch into a chroot jail,where /sysroot is treated as the root of the file-system tree
    #switch_root:/#chroot /sysroot

10. Set root passwood
    #sh-4.4# passwd root

11. Make sure that all unlabelled files, including /etc/shadow get relabelled
    #sh-4.4# touch /.autorelabel

12. type exit twice,at this point system performs relabel and reboots again  

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Selecting different target at boot time

1. Perform steps 1 to 5 in resetting password

2. Append systemd.unit=target.target
eg: systemd.unit=emergency.target

3. Press ctrl+x to boot with this changes

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Inspecting boot logs

use #journalctl to inspect logs

by default the system jounals are kept in the /run/log/journal directory which means that journals are cleared when the system reboots

To store journals edit /etc/systemd/journald.conf
set Storage=persistant

#systemctl restart systemd-journald.service

#journalctl -b -1 -p err : to inspect the logs of previous boot
